# SublimeBookmarksRedux
A better bookmark system for Sublime Text.

## Work in Progress
I'm still learning my way around Python and Sublime package development, so this will take some time. This plugin is very much a work in progress, and you probably shouldn't consider it stable (or even working) for a while.

Sublime Bookmarks Redux is an homage to SublimeBookmarks, which was the most popular plugin I have found that supports named bookmarks like this. Unfortunately due to time constraints, it's currently unmaintained. The original code for SublimeBookmarks can be found at [bollu/sublimeBookmark](https://github.com/bollu/sublimeBookmark), and I encourage you to check it out. I aim to make this project a rework of the original code, though it may take time due to learning my way around package development and how all of this code works.

## Introduction
Sublime Text has a built in bookmark system to easily mark lines of code to come back to later. Let's face it though, it doesn't support named bookmarks, and isn't really easy to use, since there's no easy way to find bookmarks without a name.

**Note:** As of right now, this is only for Sublime Text 3, since I'm unfamiliar with the quirks of porting to ST2.

## Features
As of right now, we've got nothing, but I'm slowly checking things off of the list!
